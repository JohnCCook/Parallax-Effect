            This first type of parallax is when the background stays stationary, and the foreground moves in front of it, covering it up. This is a lot easier than the next type of parallax I am  going to display, because it only requires one line of css code. Of course, to style it, you need more than one line, but the actual parallax effect itself is "background-attachment: fixed;".
